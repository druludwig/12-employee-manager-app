  ## Description
  A command-line app that demonstrates proficiency in basic SQL queries, dynamic UI lists, and asynchronous function essentials.
  
  ## Next Version
  - Add validators to user inputs.
  - Add delete functionality.
  - I ended up mixing different styles of JS in my effort to make this functional. I plan to refactor the code.
  - I also plan to test using the inquirer reactive interface functionality.
